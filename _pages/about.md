Hi, I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [the Department of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering](https://www.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China. I received my B.S. degree from [the School of Electronics and Information](https://dianzi.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/index.htm), Xiâ€™an, China, in 2023. I joined Research Center of Intelligent Internet of Things ([IIoT](https://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/)) in 2022 and have been supervised by Professor [Xiaohua Tian](https://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/#/xtian/) since then.

My research interests are hybrid communication systems, low-power ad-hoc networks and applications.
